This application allows users to create and manage a personalized list of stocks they wish to follow.
The app utilizes finnhub's API to fetch stock data and provide real-time updates.
Users can easily add or remove stocks from their list with simple actions.
Removing a stock from the list is as easy as performing a long press on the respective stock entry.
Upon clicking on a stock, the app displays daily, weekly, and monthly graphs based on the user's preferences.
